My first impression was that there were several significant gramatical errors that distracted me from the content.  Otherwise, I feel like you did a good job of establihsing the issues with traditional coal combustion, then moving to the ways coal gasifaction addresses those issues.  I did find myself wondering about the cos of producing the gasified coal which wasn't addressed as much as I wanted.  I feel like you could dive into the chemisrty involved in the process a little more which would make it more interesting to me, but its also not the focus of the paper.  Also, there is a good deal of research that I discovered that suggests natural gas may be a less environmentally friendly energy source than traditional coal because of the gases released during the fracking process so you might consider looking into that to further the arguement for coal gasification.
