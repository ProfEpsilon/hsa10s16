# Mid Term Draft
## Peer Review for Dubno
Jeffrey Rutledge

_Check spelling and punctuation_

-Should "crude oil" be capitalized

-There are a couple of places where you seem to restate the same thing with only slightly new information.
  -Try to combine these sentences into one

-Maybe add some subsections
  -In your "General Effects" section you could add subsections for the differen regions you talk about


I think you did a pretty good job describing the general story of what happened, but remember we are supposed to make some kind of **argument**, which you don't really seem to be making right now.
Maybe you could make an argument about potential solutions.
