Adams Notes
Your essay is generally well written and well argued.  There are periodic sentences with some grammatical errors, but nothing proof reading can't fix.  There are also a couple undefined terms such as when you say "air quality was seven times the safe limit", but air quality is never defined.  My main complaint is that the paper seems generally obvious and non-specific.  Perhaps you could give some additional insight on coal, such as how quickly it die out.  I also feel like the paper could benefit from a more consistent tone.  There are a couple witty comments inserted early on, but the paper is otherwise entirely serious.  I would recommend either cutting out the comedic bits or adding more throughout the paper.
