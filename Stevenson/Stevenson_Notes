Stevenson Notes
Overall, the paper was very convincing, but often felt a little off-topic.  If I correctly interpreted your argument, you were trying to argue that we should modifying existing non-generating dams to generate hydropower because it is cheap and with little environmental impact.  You did a very good job adressing cost, but didn't spend much time on the environmental impact.  You only really spent one sentence addressing the environmental impact of dam construction and another sentence saying that these essentially don't apply to retrofitting dams.  While this seems intuitively true, it might be better to address the environmental impact in greater detail so that it is more clear that the environmental drawbacks don't apply.  Meanwhile, you spend a great deal of time describing various types of dams, but this information is never really used to support any point, so it seems unnecessary to give background on the types of dams.  If you were to break down dam retrofitting by dam type, this information would become relevant, but as long as you use the generalized formula for dam cost, this information maybe doesn't need to be there.
